  <p>Agile is not <strong>what</strong> you do. Agility is <strong>how</strong> you do it - Dave Thomas</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agile devotees tend to insist that agile is the cure to all of your problems. When you have seen it fail, as it often does 
in execution and adoption, that battle cry becomes real annoying, real fast.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-a-nutshell-why-do-a-lot-of-developers-dislike-Agile">this thread</a> and you‚Äôll find 
yourself nodding your head in agreement with most of the answers to the question,‚ÄúIn a nutshell, why do a lot of developers 
dislike agile?‚Äù</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I can‚Äôt tell you the number of managers I‚Äôve seen that couldn‚Äôt manage their way out of a box ‚Äî and adopt Agile as a way 
to wave their hands and talk a lot to distract people from noticing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agile doesn‚Äôt account for the career needs of engineers at all, and that‚Äôs something that a good manager has to keep in 
mind when allocating work. Nor does it give engineers the ability to define or direct their own work in a meaningful way, 
and this repels senior talent and causes the Dead Sea Effect (most successful talent leaves most often) to set in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agile is mostly micromanagement, just sold in a way that clueless young engineers might think of it as a good thing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Notice a common theme? The concepts of the manifesto for agile software development are not the problem. The adoption and 
implementation of those concepts, however, is a major pain point.</p>

<p>Why does agile adoption fail so often? Why is there so much pushback? Because there is a fundamental misunderstanding of 
what ‚Äúagile‚Äù actually is.</p>

<p>This is perfectly encapsulated in a talk given at a conference in Amsterdam from 2015, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2244&amp;v=a-BOSpxYJ9M">Agile is Dead</a>,
from one of the creators of the manifesto, Dave Thomas.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs 40 minutes, and it‚Äôs absolutely worth your time. TL;DR:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of a mindset and a way to better develop software, over time, agile software development became Agile‚Ñ¢ - a set of 
rules to follow in order to ‚Äòdo Agile‚Äô correctly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Mr. Thomas, in order to be agile you need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find out where you are</li>
  <li>Take a small step towards your goal</li>
  <li>Adjust your understanding based on what you learned</li>
  <li>Repeat</li>
</ul>

<p>Those four notions above point to changes that must happen at the <em>macro</em> level of a business.</p>

<p>Conversely, Agile‚Ñ¢ has left us with a bunch of different methods (scrum, lean, scrumban), terms (velocity, epics, backlogs)
and roles (Scrum Master, product manager, etc) that are often cherry-picked and then presented to teams and individuals as 
the ‚Äòright way of creating software‚Äô.</p>

<p>These are not bad things! But they are <em>micro</em>-level changes.</p>

<p>And when they are cherry-picked and presented as the silver bullet to solving quality and deliverability issues, the 
problems begin to appear. Adoption failure usually isn‚Äôt far behind.</p>

<p><img src="http://acklenavenue.github.io/img/posts/agile-adoption-failure-2.jpg" alt="why agile adoption fails so often" /></p>

<p>True agile adoption means changing the way you think about your company culture, how you do business, how you deal with 
employees and clients and, yes, how you develop software.</p>

<p>Taking Agile‚Ñ¢ and then expecting it to solve all the issues at your company is a recipe for failure.</p>

<p>If you want to take on those issues at your company, you need an entire mindset change, which is, at it‚Äôs core, <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/agile-culture/">what agile
development is all about</a>.</p>
