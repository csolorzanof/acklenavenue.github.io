I"‚<p>Does any part of this story sound familiar? You‚Äôve got an earth-shattering idea. One that will disrupt an entire industry.</p>

<p>But you need some help making this idea become a reality.</p>

<p>You know you need to hire a software development team, and you want to get your idea to market as fast as possible. As long as
they get the job done, does the development method matter?</p>

<p>Below are three questions to ask yourself before selecting your development team.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-idea-do-i-have-and-what-do-i-know-about-it">What kind of idea do I have and what do I know about it?</h2>

<p>Is your idea a fairly complex one, that is slowly taking shape in your head? Maybe the features and functionality aren‚Äôt 100%
defined and there is still a fair amount of uncertainty about it.</p>

<p>Or, is your idea more straight-forward and defined? Do you know the details of your app down to the last pixel? Do you know
exactly what the value proposition is?</p>

<p>If you fall into the first bucket, you‚Äôre better off with a team that practices <a href="http://www.allaboutagile.com/what-is-agile-10-key-principles/">agile development</a>.</p>

<p>Because agile development teams are built around flexibility, they welcome change. So it makes sense that if your complex
project has a fair amount of uncertainty (and it will) you‚Äôll want to work with a team that can change direction based on
feedback and direction from you and your users. Ensuring that your dev team is focused on creating what you and your users
want.</p>

<p>An idea that is less complex and more defined could benefit from a <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_waterfall_model.htm">waterfall approach</a>.
Because everything is agreed upon at the start of the project, you and your development team can plan, design, build,
and release your idea with ease.</p>

<h2 id="am-i-concerned-about-being-beaten-to-market">Am I concerned about being beaten to market?</h2>

<p>Speed to market is at the core of the agile development mindset. In fact, three of the twelve principles of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">manifesto for
agile development</a> address this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress</li>
  <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software</li>
  <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter
timescale</li>
</ul>

<p>To put this another way, ‚ÄúAgile development is a way to get your idea to market in as little time as possible, without
sacrificing quality and without killing your people.‚Äù</p>

<p>If speed to market is important, an agile development team is your solution.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-dev-solution-will-get-me-the-most-for-my-money">What kind of dev solution will get me the most for my money?</h2>

<p>There is no guarantee that a certain type of team or development method will save you money on your project.</p>

<p>Take the example from <a href="http://tynerblain.com/blog/2013/07/09/is-agile-really-cheaper/">this article</a>.
If you need a coffee table and two different methods give you a dresser, then the method doesn‚Äôt matter. One method may
have wasted your money faster or more efficiently but they both solved the <em>wrong</em> problem.</p>

<p>Instead, a better question to ask would be; <em>‚ÄòWhat development solution will get my idea to succeed in the marketplace?‚Äô</em></p>

<p>What we‚Äôre trying to say here is that you want a development solution that will be able to uncover and solve the <em>right</em>
problems.</p>

<p>An experienced, agile team will be able to build small parts of your idea quickly, release them to market and then use that
feedback and learning to determine what to build next (i.e. what problem to solve next).</p>

<p>Repeating this process over and over again allows the team consistently reassess where you are and where you need to go next
based on what you and your users want.</p>

<p>The above process, done well, will save you money.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In case you couldn‚Äôt tell, we‚Äôre fans of agile development, we use it ourselves. And while it isn‚Äôt applicable to every
project, most software projects we come across can absolutely benefit from an agile development approach.</p>
