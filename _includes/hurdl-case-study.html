    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p class="text-block--two-columns">Hurdl is a wearable device and big data startup in the entertainment industry. They provide customizable wearables (Pixl) for large events (concerts, games, etc). Each Pixl is custom-programmed by the wearer using an event-specific survey via SMS.
        Prior to Acklen Avenue, Hurdl had the ability to custom-program the devices, but couldn’t conduct surveys of the users or send the configuration data from the cloud to the user.
