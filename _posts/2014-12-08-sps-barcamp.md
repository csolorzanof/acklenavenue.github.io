Last November 9th, San Pedro Sula (Honduras) hosted it’s annual Barcamp, this is the second time the city hosted the event and this time things got really exciting. But first things first, let’s talk a little about the city. San Pedro Sula is located in the northwest corner of Honduras, it is the second largest, population wise, city in the country. In the last couple of years the city has experienced a lot of changes in the technology area and its tech community is getting really active. Just in the last year, San Pedro Sula has hosted more than 5 big tech events including Startup Weekend, global hackathons, tech talks, and of course Barcamps.

So, everything started around 10:00am; people started arriving and registering themselves and started talking with new people. By 10:30 I gave the opening keynote, explained to newcomers what to expect with Barcamp and encouraged them to learn and share as much as possible. This year we included some coding and design challenges to keep attendees entertained. Not a lot of folks participated but it was a cool thing to do. I also took the time to thank the sponsors because without their support BarcampSPS wouldn’t be a reality.

Around 11:00am Barcamp officially started. People gathered around the big board and started picking classrooms to talk about exciting topics and experiences. Some of the talks included topics about web development, entrepreneurship, technology in sports, cryptocurrencies and more. Acklen Avenue’s Byron Sommardahl gave 3 great talks. One was about software quality secrets and another was about ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development) with [Pepino](http://app.pepino.io). We also had Adel Elmessiry, the CTO for InVivoLink, who spoke about Big Data analysis and presentation.

Parallel to the event we also invited some tech communities from the city. Some of the communities included AndroidHN, Rosalila Studio, Ubuntu, OpenSuse and a couple more. During breaks people had a chance to meet different groups and learn about them.

Overall Barcamp San Pedro Sula provided a nice space for people to meet each other, learn and have fun.  We received a little more than 130 tech enthusiasts from all over the city and some from other cities like Villanueva and Tegucigalpa.
